    "In the following exercise, we will create a simulation of an efficient trade model for self-produced goods. The model will consider consumer preferences and calculate the social utility of these goods based on all individual preferences. This involves calculating the price of the social utility for each good and the total production. A monetary base is then computed, and a percentage of it is distributed to individuals using the same parameters, taking into account their individual production. Finally, the model simulates various production scenarios with the aim of minimizing the total remaining balance for all individuals."

    "Given $k$ preferences over $n$ goods, we will construct a preference matrix with dimensions $n \\times k$. To simplify calculations, we will work with a square matrix by taking $n$ preferences. Each column of the preference matrix represents a good, and each row represents a normalized basket of preferences. We assume that all these preference baskets provide the same utility to the individual and are calculated on a 100-point preference system (assigning a value out of 100 points to each good). It's important to note that this preference matrix does not assume rationality among preferences and offers a different approach to understanding market dynamics."
